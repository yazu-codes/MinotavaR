# Riot API Integration Project

This project interacts with the **Riot API** to provide functionality related to **League of Legends** (LoL) data. It retrieves real-time data from the Riot servers, such as player statistics, game information, match history, and more. The API is used to fetch and display data about players, summoners, matches, and other relevant game details.

## Features

- Retrieve **summoner details** (level, ID, rank, etc.).
- Fetch **live match data** for summoners.
- Get **match history** and **recent games** of players.
- Supports **multiple regions** (EU, NA, KR, etc.).
- **Error handling** for invalid player names or missing data.
